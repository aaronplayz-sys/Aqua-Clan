## History about our first creation

**B**ecause this is our first project, we brainstormed ideas for what we should do and how we could bring something new to the table. It took us a few months to decide on a hide and seek game with a twist! We wanted to have a good time and give our members a memorable experience. So we made it possible for hiders and seekers to kill each other! We added buffs to swords for this purpose. The killer (also known as the seeker) spawns with a Netherite Sword, which grants speed, infinite health, and instant kills. It should be noted that the sword's only enchantment is a custom-set level of unbreaking. Command blocks handle the other effects. Hiders (also known as survivalists) can obtain a Netherite Sword capable of killing the killer. This sword grants speed and the ability to execute the murderer. Similarly, command blocks handle the sword's effects.

## How the game works
All players begin in a lobby where one player chooses to be the killer and the others must choose survivalist. Once all players have chosen a team, they are teleported to the map. The killer is imprisoned in a cave, the survivors are scattered across the map, and the killer is released once all players are ready. The survivalist team is declared the winner if a survivor is brave enough to run through the temple of boomer maze, obtain the sword, and kill the killer. If the killer kills all of the survivalists, the killer wins.

## Cool! Can me and my friends play the game?

Unfortunately, because it was part of our group's SMP server, this "minigame" as we call it is not publicly available for download. You can, however, view the minigame video on YouTube [(click to view)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-iV5p-HBD8).
